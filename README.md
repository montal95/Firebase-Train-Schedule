Choo Choo Train Tracker

This page uses firebase to hold user input for use in the table. The table of train information will update on the front end every minute and as users add more trains.

Moment.js is used to convert the time to non-military style and to display time until the next train.

The form also will display an alert if any inputs are left empty to prevent creating any rows with empty information
